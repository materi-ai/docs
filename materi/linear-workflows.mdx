# Linear System Design Specification

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the system design and operating model for using **Linear** as the execution management tool for the SaaS organization. Its goal is to:

-   Enable consistent, scalable execution
-   Preserve long-term operational efficiency
-   Prevent misuse of Linear as a documentation or knowledge system
-   Support growth without structural rewrites

This specification is intentionally opinionated and optimized for senior-level discipline.

---

## 2. Design Principles

### 2.1 Tool Boundaries

Linear is used exclusively for:

-   Work coordination
-   Execution tracking
-   Decision-making via issues

Linear is **not** used for:

-   Long-form documentation
-   Onboarding handbooks
-   Architectural knowledge bases
-   Organizational memory

All evergreen documentation lives in an external documentation system (e.g., Notion, Confluence, Slab, GitHub Docs).

---

### 2.2 Separation of Concerns

-   **Teams** represent ownership and prioritization authority
-   **Initiatives** represent strategic intent
-   **Projects** represent bounded execution
-   **Issues** represent atomic units of work
-   **Labels** represent classification, not hierarchy

---

## 3. Organizational Model

### 3.1 Work Domains (Conceptual)

The organization recognizes four primary domains of work:

-   Domain (core business logic)
-   Platform (shared infrastructure)
-   Products (customer-facing delivery)
-   Operations (internal enablement)

These domains are **conceptual value streams** and are **not mapped 1:1 to Linear Teams**.

---

### 3.2 Teams (Execution Units)

Teams are created only where independent backlog ownership and prioritization are required.

#### Approved Teams

-   **Product Engineering**

    -   Owns customer-facing features and core domain logic

-   **Platform**

    -   Owns shared infrastructure, reliability, CI/CD, observability

-   **Operations**

    -   Owns compliance, internal tooling, incident response, enablement

#### Team Description Policy

Team descriptions must be:

-   Short (2–3 sentences)
-   Execution-oriented
-   Contain a single canonical link to the team handbook

Example:

```
Product Engineering owns customer-facing features and core domain logic.

📘 Team Handbook:
https://notion.so/company/product-eng
```

---

## 4. Strategic Planning Layer

### 4.1 Initiatives

Initiatives represent long-term strategic themes (typically quarterly or longer).

Characteristics:

-   Cross-project
-   Outcome-oriented
-   Stable over time

Examples:

-   Core Domain Evolution
-   Platform Stability 2025
-   Product Growth
-   Operational Readiness

Initiatives answer the question:

> "Why are we doing this work?"

---

## 5. Execution Layer

### 5.1 Projects

Projects are the primary execution containers in Linear.

Characteristics:

-   Time-bounded (weeks to months)
-   Clearly scoped
-   Owned by a single team
-   Linked to exactly one Initiative (when applicable)

#### Naming Convention

Projects must follow this format:

```
<Category>: <Outcome>
```

Examples:

-   Domain: Pricing Engine Refactor
-   Platform: Observability v2
-   Product: Usage-Based Billing
-   Ops: SOC2 Preparation

Project descriptions must include:

-   Problem statement
-   Success criteria
-   External documentation link (if applicable)

---

### 5.2 Issues

Issues represent atomic units of work.

Rules:

-   One issue = one owner
-   One issue = one outcome
-   Issues should be completable within a few days

Issues may not be used for:

-   Brainstorms
-   Meeting notes
-   Open-ended research without a decision boundary

---

## 6. Workflow & Status Model

### 6.1 Global Statuses

All teams must use the following core workflow:

-   Backlog
-   Planned
-   In Progress
-   In Review
-   Blocked
-   Done

These statuses represent **flow state**, not human activity.

---

### 6.2 Team-Specific Extensions

Teams may add **at most one additional status** if operationally required.

Examples:

-   Platform: Deploying
-   Operations: Waiting on External

Any additional status must:

-   Be clearly defined
-   Map cleanly back to flow metrics

---

## 7. Labels & Classification

Labels are used for lightweight classification only.

Approved Labels:

-   domain
-   platform
-   product
-   ops
-   tech-debt
-   compliance

Rules:

-   Labels do not imply ownership
-   Labels do not replace Projects or Initiatives
-   Overuse of labels is discouraged

---

## 8. Documentation Strategy

### 8.1 External Documentation

All long-form documentation must live outside Linear, including:

-   Team onboarding
-   Architecture overviews
-   Operating manuals
-   Decision records

### 8.2 Linking Policy

Linear entities may link to external docs, but must not duplicate them.

Acceptable locations for links:

-   Team descriptions
-   Project descriptions
-   Issue templates

---

## 9. Operational Discipline

### 9.1 WIP Management

-   Teams should limit active Projects
-   Issues should not remain in `In Progress` without movement
-   `Blocked` must include a blocking reason

### 9.2 Hygiene Rules

-   Close issues promptly when done
-   Avoid zombie issues
-   Archive stale projects

---

## 10. Scalability & Evolution

This system is designed to:

-   Support team growth without restructuring
-   Allow reorganization by changing ownership, not hierarchy
-   Preserve historical data integrity

Future extensions may include:

-   Issue templates per work type
-   OKR alignment via Initiatives
-   Cycle-time and throughput reporting

---

## 11. Summary

This specification establishes Linear as:

-   A high-signal execution system
-   A low-friction coordination layer
-   A deliberately constrained tool

By enforcing these boundaries, the organization gains clarity, speed, and long-term operational leverage.
