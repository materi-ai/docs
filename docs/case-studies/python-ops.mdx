# The Python "Ops Glue"

While Rust and Go handle the high-performance path, Python is our weapon of choice for **Automation and Verification**.

In the Atlas, we use Python to:

1.  Run "Game Days" (load testing).
2.  Verify system integrity (e2e tests).
3.  Orchestrate complex startup sequences.

## The Game Day Script

Located in `platform/atlas/apps/python-ops/game_day.py`.

This script generates synthetic traffic to the Rust API to generate **Telemetry**. Without traffic, your Grafana dashboards are empty.

### Usage

```bash
cd platform/atlas/apps/python-ops
pip install -r requirements.txt
python game_day.py
```

This will:

1.  Hit `http://localhost/manuscript/sync`.
2.  Generate random latency (via server-side or network simulation).
3.  Populate your **Rate/Errors/Duration (RED)** metrics in Grafana.

## N8N Integration

Detailed in the next section, but Python scripts are often triggered by N8N webhooks to perform remediation actions (e.g., "Restart Service" or "Scale Up").
