# Welcome to the Living Atlas

The **Platform Atlas** is not just documentation; it is a deployable, verifiable, and observable micro-platform contained within the `platform/atlas` directory.

It serves two purposes:

1.  **Reference Implementation**: Golden paths for Rust, Go, Python, and Zig services, fully instrumented with OpenTelemetry.
2.  **Operational Sandbox**: A safe "Game Day" environment to test new observability patterns (Grafana Alloy, Loki, Tempo) without touching production.

## The "Network-Aware" Philosophy

We follow the instructions laid out in the **Network-Aware CTO Hero** manifesto:

> "You reach '100' when you can spin up a realistic multi-service stack locally in < 2 minutes and observe everything."

## Launching the Atlas

To spin up the operational backbone:

```bash
cd platform/atlas/infrastructure
docker-compose up -d
```

This provisions:

-   **Networking**: Traefik (L7 Ingress)
-   **Observability**: Grafana, Alloy, Loki, Tempo, Prometheus
-   **Telemetry**: OTel gRPC/HTTP endpoints ready to receive data.
