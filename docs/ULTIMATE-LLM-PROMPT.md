# Ultimate LLM Prompt: Materi Documentation System

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Purpose:** Reproduce complete Materi documentation deliverables
**Target:** Any LLM (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)

---

## Prompt Template

````markdown
You are a technical documentation architect for Materi, an enterprise-grade real-time collaborative document platform with event-driven microservices architecture.

# CONTEXT: Materi Architecture

Materi has 4 architectural segments:

1. **DOMAIN** (Core Microservices - Polyglot)

    - API: Go/Fiber - REST gateway, document CRUD, AI integration
    - Relay: Rust/Axum - Real-time WebSocket collaboration, Operational Transform
    - Shield: Python/Django - Auth, OAuth2/SAML, user management, RBAC
    - Manuscript: Protocol Buffers - Event schemas (50+ events across 8 domains)
    - Printery: Go - Event consumer hub, Redis Streams processing

2. **PLATFORM** (Cross-Cutting Services)

    - Aria: Python/FastAPI - AI content analysis, code safety, diagram analysis
    - Scribe: Python CLI - Documentation tooling
    - GitHub Integrations: Platform-level integrations

3. **PRODUCTS** (User-Facing)

    - Canvas: React/TypeScript monorepo (Turborepo + pnpm) - Frontend application
    - Atlas: MDX documentation hub - Technical documentation
    - **spec**: Requirements traceability (BR-_, FR-_, NFR-_, VER-_, IMPL-\*)

4. **OPERATIONS** (Infrastructure)
    - Folio: Observability aggregation hub
    - Terraform: Infrastructure as Code
    - Kubernetes: Container orchestration
    - GitOps: ArgoCD deployment patterns
    - Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger

**Event-Driven Communication:** All services communicate via Redis Streams with
Protocol Buffer event schemas defined in Manuscript.

**Tech Stack Summary:**

-   Languages: Go, Rust, Python, TypeScript
-   Databases: PostgreSQL 15+ (shared), Redis 7+ (streams, cache)
-   APIs: REST (Fiber), WebSocket (Axum), GraphQL (planned)
-   Frontend: React, Turborepo, pnpm, Storybook
-   Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry
-   Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker

# TASK 1: System Requirement Specification for Issue Templates

Create a comprehensive SRS document covering:

## 1.1 GitHub Issue Templates (YAML format)

Design templates for each segment with progressive disclosure:

**Common Templates:**

-   bug_report.yml (severity, segment, service, steps to reproduce)
-   feature_request.yml (segment-aware, requirement linking)
-   documentation.yml

**Segment-Specific Templates:**

-   domain_service_enhancement.yml (event schema changes, breaking changes, performance targets)
-   platform_ai_feature.yml (model requirements, graceful degradation, safety considerations)

-   operations_infrastructure.yml (environment, urgency, rollback plan, monitoring)

**Requirements:**

-   Dropdown validation for segments and services
-   Required fields with clear descriptions
-   Link to requirements (FR-XXX-YYY format)
-   Auto-labeling triggers
-   Template chooser configuration

## 1.2 GitHub PR Template

Include:

-   Type of change checkboxes
-   Architectural segment selection
-   Related issues linking (Fixes #, Closes #, Related to #)
-   Linked requirements (Implements: FR-XXX, Satisfies: BR-XXX, Verified by: VER-XXX)
-   Testing checklist (unit, integration, e2e, coverage >80%)
-   Documentation updates
-   Pre-merge checklist
-   Deployment notes and rollback plan

## 1.3 GitHub-to-Linear Sync Specification

-   Bidirectional comment sync only
-   Real-time sync via GitHub Actions webhook
-   Label mapping schema (50+ labels across segments, types, priorities, statuses)
-   Conflict resolution: GitHub wins (source of truth)
-   Retry policy: 3 attempts, exponential backoff
-   Sync within 5 minutes
-   Rate limiting: 60 req/min

**Label Categories:**

-   Architectural Segments: segment:domain, segment:platform, segment:products, segment:operations
-   Types: type:bug, type:feature, type:enhancement, type:performance, type:security
-   Status: status:triage, status:in-progress, status:blocked, status:review, status:done
-   Priority: priority:critical (P0), priority:high (P1), priority:medium (P2), priority:low (P3)
-   Services: service:api, service:relay, service:shield, service:aria, etc.
-   Components: component:canvas, component:atlas, etc.
-   Operations: ops:infrastructure, ops:deployment, ops:monitoring

**GitHub Action Workflow (.github/workflows/linear-sync.yml):**

```yaml
on: [issues, issue_comment]
jobs:
    sync-to-linear:
        - Sync issue metadata
        - Map labels to Linear
        - Enable comment sync
        - Add Linear link to GitHub issue
```
````

## 1.4 L1/L2 Specification Templates

-   Initiative ID format: L1-YYYY-QN-NAME
-   Strategic themes (Scalability, UX, AI/ML, Enterprise, DevEx, Operations, Security, Cost)
-   Vision statement (desired end state in 6-12 months)
-   Business objectives (measurable KPIs)
-   Affected segments (Domain, Platform, Products, Operations)
-   L2 tactical breakdown (5-10 child initiatives)
-   Success metrics with current/target values
-   Risk assessment (Low/Medium/High) with mitigation strategies
-   Cross-segment dependencies (Mermaid diagram)
-   Resource requirements (teams, budget, timeline)
-   Stakeholder sign-off (Product, Engineering, Architecture, Security, Finance)

**L2 Tactical Specification (Sprint/Quarter):**

-   L2 ID format: L2-NNN-SERVICE-FEATURE
-   Parent L1 initiative link
-   Primary segment and service/component
-   Tactical objective (specific, measurable)
-   Scope (in-scope/out-of-scope)
-   Technical approach (architecture decision, implementation steps, migration strategy)
-   Implementation tasks (breakdown into GitHub issues with estimates)
-   Acceptance criteria (definition of done checklist)
-   Testing strategy (unit, integration, load, chaos)

-   Dependencies (blocks, blocked by, related)
-   Risk level with mitigation
-   Rollback plan (trigger conditions, steps, <1 hour recovery)
-   Monitoring metrics (Grafana dashboards, Prometheus alerts)

**Example L1:** "Real-Time Collaboration at Scale" - Support 10K concurrent users with <50ms latency
**Example L2:** "Redis Streams Sharding" - Hash-based sharding, 3-node cluster, zero-downtime migration

## 1.5 Automated Workflows

**Required GitHub Actions:**

1. **auto-label.yml** - Detect segment, priority, type from issue body/title
2. **issue-routing.yml** - Route to teams based on segment labels (@materi/domain-team, etc.)
3. **dependency-tracker.yml** - Parse "Depends on #", "Blocks #", create dependency graph
4. **requirement-linking.yml** - Validate requirement links (FR-XXX format)

## 1.6 CODEOWNERS Configuration

Define reviewers per architectural segment:

```
/domain/api/ @materi/domain-team @materi/api-reviewers
/platform/aria/ @materi/platform-team @materi/ai-reviewers
/products/app/canvas/ @materi/product-team @materi/frontend-reviewers
/operations/terraform/ @materi/operations-team @materi/infra-reviewers
```

## 1.7 Implementation Roadmap

10-week phased rollout:

-   Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Issue templates, labels, basic automation
-   Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): GitHub-Linear sync
-   Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): L1/L2 specifications
-   Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8): Advanced workflows
-   Phase 5 (Weeks 9-10): Optimization and training

**Output:** Create `docs/SRS-ISSUE-TEMPLATES-WORKFLOW-ORCHESTRATION.md` (18,000+ words,
production-ready specification with complete YAML examples)
