# Aria AI Overview

Aria is Materi's integrated AI assistant, designed to enhance your content creation workflow with intelligent writing assistance, analysis capabilities, and real-time suggestions. Built on enterprise-grade language models, Aria helps teams create better content faster while maintaining quality and consistency.

## What is Aria?

Aria is an AI-powered assistant embedded throughout Materi's platform. Unlike standalone AI tools, Aria understands your workspace context, team preferences, and document history to provide relevant, personalized assistance.

## How Aria Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Context Gathering">
    When you invoke Aria, it analyzes the current document context, including:
    - Document type and purpose
    - Existing content and structure
    - Workspace style guidelines
    - Your historical preferences
  </Step>
  <Step title="Intent Recognition">
    Aria determines what you're trying to accomplish:
    - Writing new content
    - Editing existing text
    - Asking a question
    - Requesting analysis
  </Step>
  <Step title="Model Selection">
    Based on the task, Aria selects the optimal AI model:
    - Fast models for quick suggestions
    - Advanced models for complex generation
    - Specialized models for code or technical content
  </Step>
  <Step title="Response Generation">
    Aria generates a response tailored to your needs, applying:
    - Workspace tone and style settings
    - Brand voice guidelines
    - Content policies and restrictions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Safety Filtering">
    All outputs pass through safety gates to ensure:
    - Content appropriateness
    - Factual accuracy checks
    - Brand compliance
    - PII detection and handling
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Privacy and Data Handling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is my data used?">
    Your content is processed by Aria only when you explicitly request AI assistance. Materi does not use your content to train AI models. All processing occurs in isolated environments, and content is not retained after the request is completed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Where is AI processing performed?">
    AI processing occurs in your workspace's designated region. Enterprise customers can specify processing locations to meet data residency requirements.

    | Region | Processing Location |
    |--------|---------------------|
    | US | United States (us-east-1, us-west-2) |
    | EU | European Union (eu-west-1, eu-central-1) |
    | APAC | Asia Pacific (ap-southeast-1) |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I opt out of AI features?">
    Yes. Workspace administrators can disable AI features at the workspace level. Individual users can also disable AI suggestions in their personal settings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What about sensitive content?">
    Aria includes automatic PII detection and can be configured to block AI processing of sensitive content. Enterprise customers can define custom sensitivity rules.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Be specific with your requests.** Instead of "make this better," try "make this paragraph more concise and professional in tone."
</Tip>

<Note>
  Aria works best when given context. Include relevant background information in your prompts for more accurate results.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Always review AI-generated content before publishing. While Aria is highly capable, it may occasionally produce content that requires human editing.
</Warning>

### Effective Prompting

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Write about AI" | "Write a 300-word introduction to machine learning for business executives" |
| "Fix this" | "Correct grammar errors and improve sentence flow in this paragraph" |
| "Make it better" | "Enhance clarity and add concrete examples to support the main argument" |
| "Summarize" | "Create a 3-bullet executive summary highlighting key decisions needed" |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Aria is not responding">
    1. Check your internet connection
    2. Verify you haven't exceeded your plan's AI usage limits
    3. Try refreshing the page
    4. Check the [Materi Status Page](https://status.materi.io) for service issues
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Responses are slow">
    Response times vary based on request complexity:
    - Simple suggestions: 1-3 seconds
    - Content generation: 5-15 seconds
    - Complex analysis: 15-30 seconds

    If responses are consistently slow, try reducing the scope of your request.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quality of suggestions is poor">
    1. Provide more context in your prompt
    2. Be specific about the desired output format
    3. Try breaking complex requests into smaller parts
    4. Check your workspace style settings are configured correctly
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI features are disabled">
    Contact your workspace administrator. AI features may be:
    - Disabled at the workspace level
    - Restricted by your role permissions
    - Limited due to plan restrictions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
