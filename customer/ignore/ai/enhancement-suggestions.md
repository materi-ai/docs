## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Start with grammar, end with tone.** Fix grammatical errors first, then work on clarity and style. This prevents making stylistic changes to text that will be rewritten for grammar.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use bulk enhancement for final polish.** Write your draft first without interruption, then use bulk enhancement to review all suggestions at once.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Don't accept all suggestions blindly.** Aria's suggestions are recommendations. Your judgment as the author should determine the final content, especially for tone and style choices.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Calibrate over time.** Aria learns from your accept/reject patterns. Consistently providing feedback improves suggestion quality for your specific writing style.
</Note>
