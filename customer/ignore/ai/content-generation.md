## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generated content doesn't match expected style">
    **Solutions:**
    1. Check workspace style settings at **Settings > AI > Style Preferences**
    2. Provide explicit tone instructions in your prompt
    3. Include an example of the desired style
    4. Use a template that enforces your preferred format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Content is too short or too long">
    **Solutions:**
    1. Specify exact word count: "Write approximately 500 words"
    2. Define section lengths individually
    3. Use "expand" or "condense" commands on generated content
    4. Adjust the Length parameter before generating
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Generation fails or times out">
    **Common causes:**
    1. Request too complex - break into smaller parts
    2. Rate limit reached - wait a few minutes
    3. Network issues - check connection
    4. Content policy violation - review prompt for restricted terms
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Content contains inaccuracies">
    **Prevention:**
    1. Provide source context in your prompt
    2. Use "cite sources" option for research content
    3. Enable fact-checking in workspace settings
    4. Always review AI-generated factual claims

    <Warning>
      Aria generates content based on patterns, not verified facts. Always verify claims in generated content, especially for statistics, dates, and proper nouns.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Start with an outline.** Even a simple bullet list helps Aria understand your structure and produces more coherent long-form content.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Iterate, don't restart.** If the first generation isn't perfect, use refinement commands like "make this more concise" or "add more technical detail" rather than regenerating from scratch.
</Tip>

<Note>
  **Leverage workspace context.** Aria can access your other documents for context. Reference related docs in your prompt: "Using the style from our Q3 report, write..."
</Note>
