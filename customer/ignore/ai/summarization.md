# AI Summarization

Aria's summarization capabilities help you quickly understand long documents, extract key insights, and create concise briefings for stakeholders. Whether you need a quick overview or a detailed executive summary, Aria adapts the output to your specific needs.

## How Summarization Works

    subgraph Input["Document Processing"]
        A[Source Document] --> B[Content Extraction]
        B --> C[Section Analysis]
        C --> D[Key Point Identification]
    end

    subgraph Analysis["Intelligent Analysis"]
        D --> E[Importance Scoring]
        E --> F[Relationship Mapping]
        F --> G[Theme Clustering]
    end

## Advanced Summarization Features

### Multi-Document Summarization

Summarize multiple related documents into a unified summary:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Sources["Source Documents"]
        A[Document 1]
        B[Document 2]
        C[Document 3]
    end

    subgraph Processing["Aria Processing"]
        D[Content Extraction]
        E[Cross-Reference Analysis]
        F[Theme Consolidation]
        G[Conflict Resolution]
    end

    subgraph Output["Unified Summary"]
        H[Combined Summary]
        I[Source Attribution]
        J[Conflict Notes]
    end

    A --> D
    B --> D
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> G
    G --> H
    G --> I
    G --> J
```

**How to use:**
1. Select multiple documents in the document browser
2. Right-click and choose "Summarize Selected"
3. Aria identifies common themes and conflicting information
4. Review the unified summary with source attribution

### Incremental Summarization

For very long documents, Aria can create hierarchical summaries:

| Level | Description | Typical Length |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Document | Overall summary of entire document | 200-500 words |
| Section | Summary of each major section | 50-100 words each |
| Paragraph | Key point from each paragraph | 1-2 sentences each |

<Tip>
  Use incremental summarization for documents over 10,000 words. This helps maintain accuracy and allows you to drill down into specific sections.
</Tip>

### Comparative Summarization

Compare multiple versions or related documents:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Documents to Compare">
    Choose 2-5 documents for comparison. These can be:
    - Different versions of the same document
    - Competing proposals
    - Related reports from different time periods
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Comparison Type">
    Select your comparison focus:
    - **Changes**: What's different between versions
    - **Consensus**: What all documents agree on
    - **Conflicts**: Where documents disagree
    - **Evolution**: How content has changed over time
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Comparison Summary">
    Aria generates a summary highlighting:
    - Key similarities
    - Notable differences
    - Recommendations based on comparison
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Extractive vs. Abstractive Summaries

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Extractive">
    Pulls exact sentences from the original document.

    **Advantages:**
    - Preserves original wording
    - Higher accuracy for quotes
    - Clear source attribution

    **Best for:**
    - Legal documents
    - Compliance reports
    - Quotable content

    **Enable:** Add `--extractive` to summarize command or select "Use original wording" in options.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Abstractive">
    Generates new sentences that capture the meaning.

    **Advantages:**
    - More concise
    - Better flow
    - Synthesizes information

    **Best for:**
    - General summaries
    - Executive briefings
    - Cross-document summaries

    **Enable:** This is the default mode.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Integration Features

### Automatic Summary Generation

Configure automatic summaries for your workspace:

| Trigger | Summary Type | Location |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Document creation | Quick summary | Document metadata |
| Document sharing | Key points | Share notification |
| Version save | Change summary | Version history |
| Weekly digest | Executive summary | Email digest |

**Setup:**
Navigate to **Workspace Settings > AI > Auto-Summarization** to configure triggers.

### Summary Templates

Create reusable summary templates for consistent outputs:

```yaml
# Example: Weekly Status Report Summary Template
name: "Weekly Status Summary"
type: executive
sections:
  - name: "Accomplishments"
    focus: completed_items
    length: 100
  - name: "In Progress"
    focus: ongoing_items
    length: 100
  - name: "Blockers"
    focus: issues
    length: 75
  - name: "Next Week"
    focus: upcoming
    length: 75
audience: executive
total_length: 350
```

### API Access

Programmatically generate summaries via the Materi API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.materi.io/v1/ai/summarize \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "document_id": "doc_abc123",
    "type": "executive",
    "length": 300,
    "focus": "business",
    "audience": "executive"
  }'
```

## Quality and Accuracy

### Completeness Indicators

Aria indicates confidence in summary completeness:

| Indicator | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Green checkmark | High confidence, comprehensive | Ready to use |
| Yellow warning | Some content may be omitted | Review for completeness |
| Orange alert | Significant content excluded | Consider longer summary |

### Source Attribution

For compliance and verification, Aria can include source references:

<Note>
  Enable **"Include citations"** in summary options to add references back to the original document sections. This is especially useful for legal, compliance, and research summaries.
</Note>

### Handling Uncertainty

When Aria encounters ambiguous content:

- **Conflicting information**: Noted with "[Conflicting views on...]"
- **Unclear references**: Marked with "[Unclear reference]"
- **Missing context**: Indicated with "[Additional context may be needed]"

<Warning>
  Summaries are AI-generated interpretations. Always verify critical information against the source document, especially for legal, financial, or compliance purposes.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Summary misses important points">
    **Solutions:**
    1. Use a longer summary format (Executive instead of Quick)
    2. Specify focus areas: `/summarize --focus=financial`
    3. Use Key Points format to ensure comprehensive coverage
    4. Try incremental summarization for very long documents
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Summary is too generic">
    **Solutions:**
    1. Provide context: "Summarize for a technical audience"
    2. Specify what to emphasize: "Focus on action items and deadlines"
    3. Use extractive mode to preserve specific details
    4. Request a custom format with specific sections
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multi-document summary has conflicts">
    **This is expected behavior.** Aria identifies and reports conflicts between documents. Review the conflict notes section and:
    1. Determine which source is authoritative
    2. Use comparative summarization for detailed analysis
    3. Request separate summaries if documents are too different
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Summarization times out">
    **For very long documents:**
    1. Summarize sections individually
    2. Use incremental summarization
    3. Reduce summary length
    4. Contact support if issues persist with documents under 50,000 words
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Match summary type to purpose.** Use Quick summaries for triage, Key Points for meetings, and Executive summaries for stakeholders.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Specify your audience.** A summary for engineers should differ from one for executives. Always set the audience parameter.
</Tip>

<Note>
  **Review before sharing.** Even high-quality summaries benefit from a quick human review, especially for external communications.
