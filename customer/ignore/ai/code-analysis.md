## Using Code Analysis

### Inline Analysis

Enable automatic code analysis for all code blocks:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Editor > Code Analysis**
2. Toggle "Automatic code analysis" to ON
3. Configure analysis sensitivity and categories
4. Code blocks will show indicators for issues

### On-Demand Analysis

Analyze specific code blocks manually:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Keyboard Shortcut">
    1. Click inside a code block
    2. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + A`
    3. View analysis results in the panel
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Context Menu">
    1. Right-click on a code block
    2. Select "Analyze with Aria"
    3. Choose analysis type (Full, Security, Performance)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Slash Command">
    1. Place cursor in code block
    2. Type `/analyze` or `/code-review`
    3. Specify analysis focus if needed
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Analysis Results Panel

The code analysis panel displays:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Overview | Summary of findings, severity counts |
| Issues | Detailed list of detected problems |
| Suggestions | Improvement recommendations |
| Explanation | Plain-language code description |
| References | Links to relevant documentation |

## Code Transformation

### Code Refactoring

Request Aria to refactor code while preserving functionality:

**Available refactoring operations:**

| Operation | Description | Command |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Simplify | Reduce complexity | `/refactor simplify` |
| Modernize | Use current language features | `/refactor modernize` |
| Optimize | Improve performance | `/refactor optimize` |
| Document | Add comments and docs | `/refactor document` |
| Extract | Create reusable functions | `/refactor extract` |

### Code Translation

Convert code between languages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Source Code">
    Highlight the code block you want to translate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invoke Translation">
    Type `/translate to [language]` (e.g., `/translate to python`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Translation">
    Aria shows the translated code with notes about:
    - Feature differences between languages
    - Required library equivalents
    - Idiom adjustments made
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept or Modify">
    Insert the translated code or request adjustments.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Code translation provides functionally equivalent code, but may require adjustments for specific frameworks or project conventions.
</Note>

### Code Generation from Comments

Generate code from descriptive comments:

```
// Example input comment:
// Create a function that validates email addresses
// using regex and returns true/false

// Aria generates:
function validateEmail(email: string): boolean {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return emailRegex.test(email);
}
```

## Integration Features

### Documentation Generation

Generate documentation from code:

| Output Type | Description | Command |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| JSDoc/Docstring | Function documentation | `/document function` |
| README section | Usage documentation | `/document readme` |
| API reference | Endpoint documentation | `/document api` |
| Type definitions | TypeScript/Schema types | `/document types` |

### Code Embedding

### Version Comparison

Compare code versions with AI-enhanced diff:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Code Versions">
    Use version history or paste two code snippets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Comparison">
    Type `/compare` or select "Compare Versions" from the menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Analysis">
    Aria shows:
    - Line-by-line differences

    - Impact assessment
    - Potential issues introduced
  </Step>
</Steps>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Code language not detected correctly">
    **Solutions:**
    1. Specify language in code block: ` ```python `
    2. Add a comment indicating language at the top
    3. Use the language selector in the code block toolbar
    4. Check that syntax matches the intended language
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Analysis misses obvious issues">
    **Solutions:**
    1. Ensure the code is syntactically complete (not a fragment)
    2. Increase analysis sensitivity in settings
    3. Check that the relevant analysis category is enabled
    4. Provide more context (e.g., include imports)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Too many false positives">
    **Solutions:**
    1. Lower analysis sensitivity
    2. Configure language-specific rules
    3. Add exceptions for intentional patterns
    4. Use inline comments to suppress warnings: `// aria-ignore`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Code explanation is inaccurate">
    **Solutions:**
    1. Ensure code is complete and not truncated
    2. Include necessary imports/context
    3. Specify the framework being used
    4. Use detailed explanation level for complex code
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Include context.** When analyzing code snippets, include relevant imports, type definitions, or comments that help Aria understand the full picture.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use specific commands.** Instead of just "analyze," specify what you want: "analyze for security," "explain for junior developers," or "suggest performance improvements."
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Review security suggestions carefully.** While Aria identifies common vulnerability patterns, security requirements vary by context. Consult security professionals for critical applications.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Code stays in your workspace.** Code analysis is performed with the same privacy guarantees as other AI features. Your code is not stored or used for training.
</Note>

<Info>
  **Usage Limits:** Code analysis counts toward your plan's AI usage quota. Simple analyses (error detection, syntax) use fewer credits than complex operations (full review, translation).
