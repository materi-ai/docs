## Encryption in Transit

All data transmitted to and from Materi is protected using TLS 1.3, the latest and most secure transport layer security protocol.

### TLS Configuration

| Setting | Configuration |
|---------|---------------|
| Protocol Version | TLS 1.3 (TLS 1.2 supported for legacy) |
| Cipher Suites | TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 |
| Key Exchange | X25519, secp384r1 |
| Certificate Type | RSA-4096 or ECDSA P-384 |
| HSTS | Enabled with 1-year max-age |
| Certificate Transparency | Required for all certificates |

<Tip>
  Use [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) to verify our TLS configuration. Materi consistently achieves an A+ rating.
</Tip>

### Connection Security by Service

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Connections">
    All REST API connections use HTTPS with TLS 1.3:

    ```bash
    # Verify TLS configuration
    curl -v https://api.materi.io/health 2>&1 | grep "SSL connection"
    # SSL connection using TLSv1.3 / TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
    ```

    **Security Headers Applied:**
    - `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`
    - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
    - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
    - `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="WebSocket Connections">
    Real-time collaboration uses secure WebSocket connections (WSS):

    - TLS 1.3 encryption on all WebSocket connections
    - Per-message authentication using JWT tokens
    - Connection heartbeat with encrypted health checks
    - Automatic reconnection with session resumption

    <Note>
      WebSocket connections inherit the same TLS configuration as HTTPS connections, ensuring consistent security.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Internal Services">
    Service-to-service communication uses mutual TLS (mTLS):

    - Both client and server present certificates
    - Certificates issued by internal CA with 24-hour validity
    - Automatic certificate rotation
    - Service mesh encryption (Istio/Linkerd compatible)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Certificate Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Certificate Authority">
    Materi uses certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities:

    - Production: DigiCert, Let's Encrypt (backup)
    - Certificates renewed 30 days before expiration
    - Certificate pinning available for mobile applications
    - CAA DNS records restrict certificate issuance
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Certificate Transparency">
    All certificates are logged to public CT logs:

    - Enables monitoring for unauthorized certificate issuance
    - CT log monitoring alerts on unexpected certificates
    - Supports SCT (Signed Certificate Timestamp) validation
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom Domains">
    For custom domains (Enterprise):

    - Automatic TLS certificate provisioning via Let's Encrypt
    - Option to upload your own certificates
    - Wildcard certificate support
    - DNS validation or HTTP-01 challenge support
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Encryption at Rest

All stored data is encrypted using AES-256, the gold standard for symmetric encryption approved by NIST and used by government agencies worldwide.

### Data Encryption Layers

    - **Unique Keys**: Each file encrypted with a unique DEK
    - **Envelope Encryption**: DEKs encrypted with workspace KEK
    - **Secure Deletion**: Cryptographic erasure via key deletion

    <Note>
      File encryption keys are rotated every 90 days. Existing files are re-encrypted during the next access or during scheduled maintenance.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Backup Encryption">
    ### Backup Security

    All backups are encrypted before leaving the source system:

    - **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with authenticated encryption
    - **Key Isolation**: Backup keys stored separately from data keys
    - **Geographic Distribution**: Encrypted backups replicated across regions
    - **Integrity Verification**: SHA-256 checksums verified on restore

    Backup retention:
    | Backup Type | Retention | Encryption |
    |-------------|-----------|------------|
    | Continuous | 24 hours | Per-backup key |
    | Daily | 30 days | Workspace KEK |
    | Weekly | 90 days | Workspace KEK |
    | Monthly | 1 year | Archive key |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Key Management

Materi implements a hierarchical key management system that balances security with operational efficiency.

### Key Hierarchy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Master Encryption Keys (MEK)">
    Root keys stored in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):

    - FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified HSMs
    - Never exported from HSM boundary
    - Dual-control, split-knowledge key ceremonies
    - Annual key rotation with automated re-encryption
  </Step>
  <Step title="Key Encryption Keys (KEK)">
    Intermediate keys that encrypt data encryption keys:

    - One KEK per workspace (isolation boundary)
    - Encrypted by MEK and stored in secure key store
    - Rotated every 90 days automatically
    - Support for customer-managed keys (BYOK)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Encryption Keys (DEK)">
    Keys that directly encrypt your data:

    - Unique per resource (document, file, etc.)
    - Short-lived with frequent rotation
    - Encrypted by KEK (envelope encryption)
    - Enables granular access control
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Key Rotation

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Automatic Rotation" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Keys rotate automatically based on policy:
    - MEK: Annually
    - KEK: Every 90 days
    - DEK: Per resource or 30 days

    No action required from customers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="On-Demand Rotation" icon="rotate">
    Enterprise customers can trigger immediate rotation:
    - Via admin dashboard
    - Via API call
    - After suspected compromise
    - For compliance requirements
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Customer-Managed Keys (BYOK)

<Note>
  Customer-managed keys are available on the Enterprise plan only.
</Note>

Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) gives you full control over your encryption keys while leveraging Materi's infrastructure.

### BYOK Architecture

### Configuring BYOK

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Your Key">
    Create a 256-bit AES key or RSA-4096 key in your KMS:

    ```bash
    # AWS KMS example
    aws kms create-key \
      --description "Materi workspace encryption key" \
      --key-usage ENCRYPT_DECRYPT \
      --key-spec SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure IAM Permissions">
    Grant Materi access to use (not manage) your key:

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/MateriEncryption"
        },
        "Action": [
          "kms:Encrypt",
          "kms:Decrypt",
          "kms:GenerateDataKey"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
      }]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register Key in Materi">
    Navigate to **Settings > Security > Encryption > Customer Keys** and add your key ARN or reference.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable for Workspace">

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Encryption errors when uploading files">
    If you encounter encryption errors during file upload:

    1. Check file size limits (encryption adds overhead)
    2. Verify your browser supports required cryptographic APIs
    3. Check for network interruptions during upload
    4. Try a different browser or disable browser extensions
    5. Contact support if using BYOK with key access issues
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="BYOK key access denied errors">
    When customer-managed keys fail:

    1. Verify IAM/access policies grant Materi the required permissions
    2. Check key state (enabled, not pending deletion)
    3. Verify network connectivity between Materi and your KMS
    4. Review KMS logs for specific error details
    5. Test key access using your cloud provider's CLI
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance impact from encryption">
    If you notice performance degradation:

    1. Encryption overhead is typically less than 5%
    2. Large file operations may take longer due to encryption
    3. BYOK adds latency for KMS calls (cache TTL: 5 minutes)
    4. Contact support for performance optimization recommendations
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verifying data is encrypted">
    To confirm your data is encrypted:

    1. Request an encryption verification report from **Settings > Security > Reports**
    2. Enterprise customers can audit encryption via API
    3. SOC 2 reports include encryption control testing
    4. Request a data export and verify files are encrypted at rest
