# Security Overview

Materi is built with security at its core, implementing defense-in-depth strategies to protect your organization's most valuable content. Our security architecture combines enterprise-grade encryption, robust access controls, and comprehensive audit capabilities to meet the most stringent compliance requirements.

## Security Architecture

Our multi-layered security model ensures protection at every level of the platform.

## Core Security Principles

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Zero Trust Architecture" icon="lock">
    Every request is authenticated and authorized, regardless of network location. No implicit trust is granted based on network segmentation alone.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Defense in Depth" icon="layer-group">
    Multiple overlapping security controls ensure that the failure of one control does not compromise the entire system.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Least Privilege Access" icon="user-lock">
    Users and services receive only the minimum permissions required to perform their functions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Security by Design" icon="drafting-compass">
    Security is integrated into every phase of development, not added as an afterthought.
  </Card>
