## Authentication Methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Password Authentication">
    ### Password-Based Login

    Available on all plans, password authentication provides secure local account management with industry-standard protections.

    #### Password Requirements

    | Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
    |------------|---------|-------------|
    | Length | 10 characters | 14+ characters |
    | Complexity | 3 of 4 character types | All character types |
    | History | Last 5 passwords blocked | Last 12 passwords |
    | Expiration | 90 days (configurable) | 180 days with MFA |

    <Note>
      Password requirements can be customized by workspace administrators. Enterprise customers can enforce organizational password policies.
    </Note>

    #### Enabling Password Authentication

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Navigate to Security Settings">
        Go to **Settings > Security > Authentication Methods** in your workspace admin panel.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure Password Policy">
        Set minimum length, complexity requirements, and expiration periods based on your security policy.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Enable Account Lockout">

      </Step>
      <Step title="Save and Test">
        Save your configuration and test with a non-admin account to verify the policy works as expected.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OAuth 2.0">

      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Warning>
      Always test SSO configuration with a test account before enforcing SSO-only authentication. Ensure at least one admin account retains password access for emergency recovery.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Multi-Factor Authentication

MFA adds a critical second layer of security to protect accounts from credential compromise.

### MFA Architecture

```mermaid

    subgraph Primary["Primary Authentication"]
        Password["Password"]
        OAuth["OAuth Token"]
        SAML["SAML Assertion"]
    end

    subgraph MFA["Second Factor"]
        TOTP["TOTP App"]
        SMS["SMS Code"]
        Hardware["Hardware Key"]
        Push["Push Notification"]
    end

    subgraph Access["Access Decision"]
        Verify["Verify Both Factors"]
        Grant["Grant Access"]
        Deny["Deny Access"]
    end

    Primary --> Verify
    MFA --> Verify
    Verify -->|Success| Grant
    Verify -->|Failure| Deny
```

### Available MFA Methods

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authenticator App (TOTP)">
    **Available on all plans**

    Time-based One-Time Passwords using apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password.

    - 6-digit codes that refresh every 30 seconds
    - Works offline without cellular or internet connection
    - Recovery codes provided during setup for emergency access

    **Recommended for**: All users as the primary MFA method.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="SMS Verification">
    **Available on Business and Enterprise plans**

    One-time codes sent via SMS to verified phone numbers.

    - Familiar user experience
    - No app installation required
    - Subject to SIM-swapping risks

    <Warning>
      SMS-based MFA is less secure than authenticator apps due to SIM-swapping attacks. Use only as a backup method or when app-based MFA is not feasible.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hardware Security Keys">
    **Enterprise plan only**

    FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware keys like YubiKey provide the strongest authentication security.

    - Supports multiple keys per account

    **Recommended for**: Admin accounts and high-security environments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Push Notifications">
    **Enterprise plan only**

    Approve login requests via the Materi mobile app with biometric verification.

    - One-tap approval with biometric confirmation
    - Location and device information displayed
    - Automatic timeout after 60 seconds

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="SSO login fails with 'Invalid SAML Response'">
    This typically indicates a configuration mismatch between Materi and your IdP:

    1. Verify the ACS URL in your IdP matches exactly: `https://your-workspace.materi.io/saml/acs`
    2. Check that the clock on your IdP server is synchronized (SAML assertions are time-sensitive)
    3. Ensure the certificate in Materi matches your IdP's signing certificate
    4. Review the SAML response in browser developer tools for specific error messages
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="MFA codes are not working">
    If TOTP codes are consistently rejected:

    1. Verify your device clock is accurate (enable automatic time sync)
    2. Ensure you are using codes for the correct account
    3. Try generating a new code and entering it immediately
    4. If issues persist, use a recovery code and re-enroll in MFA
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Users cannot access workspace after SSO is enabled">
    When enabling SSO-only authentication:

    1. Ensure all users have accounts in your IdP with matching email addresses
    2. Verify attribute mapping includes required fields (email is mandatory)
    3. Check that the user's IdP groups map to Materi workspace access
    4. Temporarily enable password fallback for debugging
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="OAuth login redirects to wrong workspace">
    This occurs when OAuth credentials are shared across workspaces:

    1. Create separate OAuth applications for each workspace
    2. Verify the redirect URI includes the correct workspace subdomain
    3. Check for cached authentication state in the browser
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sessions are expiring too quickly">
    If users report frequent logouts:

    1. Check session timeout settings in **Settings > Security > Sessions**
    2. Verify idle timeout is not set too low for your use case
    3. Review if concurrent session limits are being exceeded
    4. Check for issues with refresh token rotation
  </Accordion>
