# Access Controls

Materi's access control system provides granular, role-based permissions that scale from small teams to large enterprises. Our RBAC implementation ensures users have exactly the access they need while maintaining security and compliance requirements.

## Access Control Architecture

```

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC allows you to define roles with specific permissions and assign them to users, simplifying access management at scale.

### System Roles

Materi includes predefined system roles suitable for most organizations:

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full workspace control | All permissions, billing, deletion |
| **Admin** | Administrative access | User management, settings, all content |
| **Editor** | Content creation | Create, edit, delete own content |
| **Commenter** | Feedback and review | View, comment on shared content |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access | View shared content only |
| **Guest** | Limited external access | View specific shared items |

<Note>
  System roles cannot be modified, but you can create custom roles with similar permissions if you need variations.
</Note>

    Project["Project Level"]
    Folder["Folder Level"]
    Document["Document Level"]

    Workspace -->|inherits| Project
    Project -->|inherits| Folder

## Access Control Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Principle of Least Privilege" icon="user-lock">
    Grant users the minimum permissions required for their job function.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Regular Access Reviews" icon="clipboard-check">
    Periodically review and revoke unnecessary access (quarterly recommended).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Groups Over Individuals" icon="users">
    Assign permissions to groups rather than individual users for easier management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document Custom Roles" icon="file-lines">
    Maintain documentation explaining the purpose of each custom role.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User cannot access shared document">
    If a user reports access issues:

    1. Verify the document sharing settings include the user
    2. Check if the user is part of a group that has access
    3. Review any access policies that might block access
    4. Confirm the user's role has the required permissions
    5. Check for conflicting deny rules
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="SCIM sync not updating group membership">
    When SCIM group sync fails:

    1. Verify the SCIM token has not expired
    2. Check IdP logs for sync errors
    3. Confirm group names match between systems
    4. Review SCIM attribute mapping for groups
    5. Test with a manual SCIM API call
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom role permissions not working as expected">
    If custom roles behave unexpectedly:

    1. Review the base role and its inherited permissions
    2. Check for permission conflicts in the role definition
    3. Verify scope restrictions are not limiting access
    4. Test with a user who only has the custom role assigned
    5. Review audit logs for permission denial reasons
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Access policy blocking legitimate users">
    When access policies cause false positives:

    1. Review policy conditions (IP, time, device)
    2. Check policy evaluation order
    3. Temporarily disable the policy to confirm it is the cause
    4. Add exceptions for legitimate use cases
    5. Consider adjusting risk thresholds
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cannot assign Owner role to another user">
    Ownership transfer limitations:

    1. Only current Owners can transfer ownership
    2. The target user must have MFA enabled
    3. Ownership transfer requires email confirmation
    4. Some plans limit the number of Owners
    5. Contact support if ownership transfer is blocked
  </Accordion>
