## How Materi Works

Materi is built around three core concepts that work together:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Your Organization"
        W[Workspaces]
        D[Documents]
        M[Members]
    end

    W --> D
    W --> M
    M --> D

    D --> AI[AI Features]
    D --> C[Collaboration]
    D --> I[Integrations]
```

### Workspaces

Workspaces are the organizational boundary for your team. Each workspace has:

- **Members** with assigned roles (Owner, Admin, Member, Guest)
- **Documents** organized in folders and collections
- **Settings** for permissions, integrations, and billing
- **Audit logs** for compliance and security

Most organizations use one workspace per team or department.

### Documents

Documents are where work happens. Materi documents support:

- **Rich text editing** with Markdown support
- **Code blocks** with syntax highlighting for 100+ languages
- **Embedded media** including images, videos, and files
- **Real-time collaboration** with multiple simultaneous editors
- **Version history** to track changes over time
- **Comments and mentions** for discussions

### Collaboration

When multiple people work on a document:

1. You see **live cursors** showing where teammates are editing
2. Changes sync **instantly** across all connected devices
3. Conflicts are **automatically resolved** using operational transforms
4. **Offline edits** sync when you reconnect
