## Engineering Teams

### Technical Documentation

Maintain living documentation that evolves with your codebase:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    CODE[Code Changes] --> DOC[Documentation]
    DOC --> REVIEW[Review]
    REVIEW --> PUBLISH[Published Docs]
    PUBLISH --> FEEDBACK[User Feedback]
    FEEDBACK --> DOC
```

**Key workflows:**

- **API documentation** with code examples that stay current
- **Architecture decision records** (ADRs) with full version history
- **Runbooks** for operational procedures
- **Onboarding guides** for new engineers

<Tip>
Use the GitHub integration to link documentation to specific commits and automatically surface when docs might be outdated.
</Tip>

### Incident Response

Document incidents in real-time with your team:

1. Create an incident document from template
2. Multiple responders add updates simultaneously
3. Use AI to summarize timeline into postmortem
4. Track action items with checklists

**Template sections:**

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Timeline | Chronological event log |
| Impact | Users/systems affected |
| Root Cause | Technical analysis |
| Action Items | Follow-up tasks |
| Lessons Learned | Process improvements |

### Code Review Notes

Supplement PRs with detailed context:

- Explain complex changes for reviewers
- Document trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Link to related architecture decisions
- Use code blocks for inline examples
