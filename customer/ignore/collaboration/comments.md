# Comments & Discussions

Materi's commenting system enables rich, contextual conversations directly within your documents. Add feedback, ask questions, start discussions, and resolve issues without leaving your workflow.

## Comment System Architecture

        B --> C[Comment Thread]

    end

        C --> J[Assign]
    end

        D --> L[In-App]
        D --> M[Slack/Teams]
    end
```

Comments are anchored to specific content in your document. As the document changes, comments intelligently reposition to stay attached to the relevant text, even when content is moved or edited.

## Creating Comments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Content">
    Highlight the text or element you want to comment on. For point comments, simply place your cursor at the desired location.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Comment Panel">
    Use any of these methods:
    - Click the **comment icon** in the floating toolbar
    - Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + M`
    - Right-click and select **Add Comment**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Your Comment">
    Enter your comment in the text field. You can use:
    - **Markdown** for formatting (bold, italic, lists, code)
    - **@mentions** to notify specific users
    - **Emoji** reactions and expressions
    - **Links** to external resources or other documents
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit Comment">
    Click **Comment** or press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to post. The comment appears immediately for all collaborators.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Comment Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Inline Comments">
    **Anchored to specific text or elements**

    Inline comments attach to selected content and move with it as the document is edited. They're ideal for:
    - Specific feedback on wording or content
    - Questions about particular sections
    - Suggestions for changes
    - Corrections and edits

    Visual indicator: Yellow highlight on anchored text with comment icon in margin.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Point Comments">
    **Attached to a specific position**

    Point comments mark a location without highlighting text. Use them for:
    - Noting where content should be added
    - Marking structural issues
    - Indicating missing elements
    - General position-based notes

    Visual indicator: Comment pin icon at the exact position.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Document Comments">
    **General feedback not tied to specific content**

    Document-level comments appear in the comments panel but aren't anchored to content. Perfect for:
    - Overall document feedback
    - General questions
    - Meta-discussions about approach
    - Summary reviews

    Access via the **Comments** panel > **Document Comments** tab.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Suggestion Comments">
    **Proposed changes with accept/reject workflow**

    Suggestions are special comments that propose specific text changes:
    - Show before/after comparison
    - One-click accept or reject
    - Batch operations for multiple suggestions
    - Track who suggested and who resolved

    Create by selecting text and clicking **Suggest Edit** instead of **Comment**.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Comment Features

### Formatting Options

Comments support rich formatting via Markdown:

| Format | Syntax | Result |

| Bold | `**text**` | **text** |

  Use triple backticks for code blocks with syntax highlighting:
  ~~~
  ```javascript
  const example = "highlighted code";
  ```
  ~~~
