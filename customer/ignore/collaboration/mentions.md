# @Mentions & Notifications

Materi's @mention system helps you bring the right people into conversations, create clear accountability, and ensure important updates reach the right team members instantly.

## How @Mentions Work

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Author
    participant Materi
    participant Mentioned User
    participant Notification Service

    Author->>Materi: Types @username
    Materi->>Materi: Validate user access
    Materi->>Materi: Create mention record
    Materi->>Notification Service: Trigger notifications

    par Multi-channel delivery
        Notification Service->>Mentioned User: In-app notification
        Notification Service->>Mentioned User: Email notification
        Notification Service->>Mentioned User: Slack/Teams message
    end

    Mentioned User->>Materi: Clicks notification
    Materi->>Mentioned User: Navigate to mention context
```

When you @mention someone, Materi creates a trackable reference that notifies the user across all their configured channels and provides them direct access to the relevant context.

## Creating @Mentions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Typing @">
    In any text field that supports mentions (comments, documents, descriptions), type the `@` symbol.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for User">
    A dropdown appears showing matching users. You can search by:
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Email address
    - Username
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select User">
    Click on the user or use arrow keys and Enter to select. The mention appears as a highlighted link.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Your Message">
    Finish writing your message. The mentioned user will be notified when you submit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Type the first few letters after @ to quickly filter the user list. For example, `@sar` will show users like "Sarah", "Sarita", etc.
</Tip>

## Mention Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="User Mentions">
    **@username** - Mention a specific person

    The most common type. Notifies one individual and creates a direct link to them.

    ```
    @sarah.martinez Can you review this section?
    ```

    User mentions are available for:
    - Workspace members
    - Document collaborators
    - Guest users with access
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Team Mentions">
    **@team-name** - Mention an entire team

    Notifies all members of a team. Useful for broader announcements or group requests.

    ```
    @engineering Please review the API documentation updates.
    ```

    <Note>
      Team mentions require the team to exist in your workspace settings. Contact your admin to create teams.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Role Mentions">
    **@role** - Mention by role

    Reach everyone with a specific role, regardless of team.

    ```
    @reviewers This document is ready for review.
    @admins Need help with permissions.
    ```

    Available roles depend on your workspace configuration.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Special Mentions">
    **@all** / **@here** - Broadcast mentions

    | Mention | Reaches | Use Case |

    | `@here` | Currently active users | Urgent, time-sensitive items |
    | `@owner` | Document owner | Ownership questions |
    | `@assigned` | All assignees | Task-related updates |

    <Warning>
      @all and @here should be used sparingly. Excessive use may result in notification fatigue and can be restricted by workspace admins.
    </Warning>

    - Tomorrow morning
    - Next week

## Mention Best Practices

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Do">
    **Effective @mention usage:**

    - Be specific about what you need
    - Use team mentions for group input
    - Mention the right level (individual vs. team)
    - Provide context in your message
    - Use @here for time-sensitive items
    - Follow up if no response after reasonable time

    ```
    Good: "@sarah.martinez Could you review the API
    section by Thursday? Specifically looking for
    feedback on the authentication flow."

    Good: "@engineering This affects your Q4 roadmap.
    Please review by EOD."
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Don't">
    **Avoid these patterns:**

    - Mentioning people who don't have access
    - Using @all for non-urgent matters
    - Mentioning large groups unnecessarily
    - Multiple mentions for the same request
    - Mentions without context or action needed
    - Using mentions as read receipts

    ```
    Bad: "@all FYI we updated the logo"

    Bad: "@james @sarah @mike @lisa @tom
    @engineering @design thoughts?"

    Bad: "@sarah ?"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Mention Permissions

| Mention Type | Who Can Use | Who Gets Notified |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| @user | Anyone with comment access | Mentioned user (if has access) |
| @team | Team members and admins | All team members with access |
| @all | Edit permission or higher | All collaborators |
| @here | Edit permission or higher | Active collaborators only |
| @owner | Anyone with access | Document owner |

<Note>
  Users without access to a document won't be notified even if mentioned. The mention will appear but won't create a notification.
</Note>

    [Open in Materi] [Reply in Thread]
    ```

    Users can reply from Slack/Teams and it syncs back to Materi.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User doesn't appear in mention dropdown">
    The user may not have access to the document or workspace:

    1. Verify the user is a workspace member
    2. Check if they have access to the specific document
    3. Ensure they haven't been deactivated
    4. Try searching by email instead of name
    5. Ask an admin to verify user status
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mentioned user didn't receive notification">
    Check these common causes:

    1. **Access**: User doesn't have access to the document
    2. **Settings**: User disabled mention notifications
    3. **Quiet hours**: User is in quiet hours
    4. **Muted**: User muted the thread or document
    5. **Spam**: Email went to spam folder
    6. **Integration**: Slack/Teams not connected

    The mentioned user can verify in **Settings > Notifications > Activity Log**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Getting too many mention notifications">
    Reduce notification volume:

    1. Switch to digest mode (hourly/daily)
    2. Mute specific threads or documents
    3. Disable team/broadcast mentions
    4. Set up quiet hours
    5. Ask teammates to be more selective with mentions
    6. Contact admin about mention policies
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mention link is broken">
    If clicking a mention doesn't navigate correctly:

    1. The mentioned content may have been deleted
    2. Your access may have changed
    3. Try refreshing the page
    4. Clear browser cache
    5. The document may have been moved - check with owner
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
