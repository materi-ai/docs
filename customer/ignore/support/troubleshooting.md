## Login & Authentication Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I cannot log in to my account">
    **Symptoms**: Login page shows error, password not accepted, or page keeps refreshing.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Verify your email address">
        Ensure you are entering the correct email address associated with your account. Check for typos or extra spaces.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Reset your password">
        Click "Forgot Password" on the login page and follow the instructions sent to your email. Check spam/junk folders if you do not receive the email within 5 minutes.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Check for SSO requirements">
        If your organization uses Single Sign-On (SSO), you may need to log in through your company's identity provider. Look for a "Sign in with SSO" button.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Clear browser data">
        Clear cookies and cached data for materi.io:
        - **Chrome**: Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data
        - **Firefox**: Settings > Privacy > Clear Data
        - **Safari**: Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data
      </Step>
      <Step title="Try incognito/private mode">
        Open an incognito window and try logging in. If this works, a browser extension may be interfering.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Warning>
    After 5 failed login attempts, your account will be temporarily locked for 15 minutes. Wait and try again, or use password reset.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Two-factor authentication is not working">
    **Symptoms**: 2FA codes are rejected, authenticator app shows different codes, or cannot access backup codes.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Check time synchronization">
        Authenticator apps depend on accurate time. Ensure your phone's time is set to automatic:
        - **iOS**: Settings > General > Date & Time > Set Automatically
        - **Android**: Settings > System > Date & Time > Automatic
      </Step>
      <Step title="Try your backup codes">
        If you saved your backup codes during 2FA setup, use one to log in. Each code can only be used once.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Wait for new code">
        TOTP codes refresh every 30 seconds. Wait for a fresh code and enter it immediately.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Contact support for recovery">
        If you cannot access your 2FA device or backup codes, contact support with:
        - Your account email
        - Government-issued ID for verification
        - Last known login date/location
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Session keeps expiring unexpectedly">
    **Symptoms**: Frequently logged out, asked to re-authenticate often.

    **Possible causes and solutions**:

    | Cause | Solution |
    |-------|----------|
    | Browser blocking cookies | Allow cookies for materi.io in browser settings |
    | VPN/Network switching | Use a stable network connection |
    | Multiple devices | Log out from other devices in Settings > Security > Sessions |
    | Browser extensions | Disable privacy extensions temporarily |
    | Admin security policy | Check with your admin for session timeout settings |

    <Tip>
    Enable "Remember me" on the login page for 30-day sessions instead of the default 24 hours.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SSO login fails with error">
    **Symptoms**: Error messages from identity provider, redirect loops, or access denied.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="For Users">
        1. Ensure you are using your corporate email, not a personal one
        2. Try logging in through your company's SSO portal first
        3. Clear browser cookies and cache
        4. Contact your IT administrator to verify your access
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="For Administrators">
        1. Verify SAML configuration in Materi admin panel
        2. Check that assertion consumer service URL is correct
        3. Ensure user attributes are mapped correctly
        4. Review identity provider logs for detailed error messages
        5. Verify the SSL certificate has not expired

## Document Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Changes are not saving">
    **Symptoms**: Save indicator spinning, changes disappear after refresh, "Unable to save" error.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Check your internet connection">
        Materi requires an active internet connection to save changes. Verify your connection by visiting another website.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Look for the save indicator">
        - **Cloud icon**: All changes saved
        - **Spinning icon**: Save in progress
        - **Red icon**: Save failed - hover for details
      </Step>
      <Step title="Check for conflicts">
        If another user made changes simultaneously, you may see a conflict notification. Review and merge changes manually.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Copy your work">
        Before troubleshooting further, select all content (Cmd/Ctrl + A) and copy it (Cmd/Ctrl + C) to avoid losing work.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Force refresh">
        Press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R to perform a hard refresh. This clears cached data that may be causing issues.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Note>
    Materi auto-saves every 3 seconds. If the document has not saved in over 30 seconds, there is likely a connection issue.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document loads slowly or times out">
    **Symptoms**: Long loading times, blank page, timeout errors.

    **Check document size and complexity**:

    | Issue | Solution |
    |-------|----------|
    | Large images | Compress images or use external hosting |
    | Too many embeds | Remove unused embedded content |
    | Extensive version history | Export and create a fresh copy |
    | Complex tables | Split into multiple simpler tables |
    | Many comments | Archive or resolve old comments |

    <Tip>
    Documents over 50MB may experience performance issues. Consider splitting large documents into sections.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot access a shared document">
    **Symptoms**: "Access denied", "Document not found", or permission errors.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Verify the link">
        Ensure the link is complete and has not been truncated. Ask the owner to resend if needed.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Check your account">
        The share may be restricted to specific email addresses. Ensure you are logged in with the correct account.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Request access">
        Click the "Request Access" button if available. The document owner will receive a notification.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Check expiration">
        Shared links can have expiration dates. Ask the owner to create a new share link.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Warning>
    If you previously had access but now do not, your permissions may have been revoked. Contact the document owner or your workspace admin.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Formatting looks wrong or is lost">
    **Symptoms**: Styles not displaying correctly, formatting changes after save, imported documents look different.

    **Common formatting issues and fixes**:

    | Issue | Cause | Solution |
    |-------|-------|----------|
    | Fonts changed | Custom fonts not available | Use web-safe fonts or upload custom fonts (Enterprise) |
    | Colors different | Browser color profiles | Check document in different browser |
    | Tables misaligned | Column width issues | Reset table formatting (right-click > Reset Table) |
    | Lists broken | Nested list complexity | Simplify list structure |
    | Code not highlighted | Language not detected | Manually set language in code block menu |

    <Tip>
    When importing from Word or Google Docs, use "Paste without formatting" (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + V) for cleaner results.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document appears blank or corrupted">
    **Symptoms**: Empty document, garbled text, or missing sections.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Check version history">
        Click History (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + H) to view previous versions. Restore a working version if available.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Try a different browser">
        Some rendering issues are browser-specific. Try Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Disable browser extensions">
        Ad blockers and privacy extensions can interfere with document rendering.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Contact support">
        If the document remains corrupted, contact support with the document URL. Our team can often recover content from backups.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>

## Collaboration Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cannot see other collaborators' cursors or changes">
    **Symptoms**: Real-time collaboration not working, changes from others not appearing, no presence indicators.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Check WebSocket connection">
        Look for a red dot next to your avatar - this indicates a connection issue. Try refreshing the page.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify collaborator permissions">
        Viewers can see changes but editors may have restricted visibility. Check document permissions.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Check firewall/proxy settings">
        WebSocket connections (wss://) may be blocked by corporate firewalls. Contact your IT team to allow:
        - `wss://relay.materi.io`
        - Port 443
      </Step>
      <Step title="Disable VPN temporarily">
        Some VPNs interfere with WebSocket connections. Try disconnecting briefly to test.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant User A
        participant Materi Server
        participant User B

        User A->>Materi Server: Connect WebSocket
        Materi Server-->>User A: Connection established
        User B->>Materi Server: Connect WebSocket
        Materi Server-->>User B: Connection established

        User A->>Materi Server: Make edit
        Materi Server->>User B: Broadcast change
        Note over User B: If no change appears,<br/>WebSocket may be blocked
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Comments or mentions not working">
    **Symptoms**: Cannot add comments, mentions not showing suggestions, notifications not received.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Comment Issues">
        **Cannot add comments**:
        - Ensure you have Comment or Edit permissions
        - Select text before clicking the comment button
        - Check that the document is not in read-only mode

        **Comments not visible**:
        - Click the Comments icon to show/hide the sidebar
        - Check filter settings (may be hiding resolved comments)
        - Refresh the page
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Mention Issues">
        **Mentions not suggesting names**:
        - Type `@` and wait 1-2 seconds for suggestions
        - Ensure the user is a member of the workspace
        - Check that you are in a comment or document body (not title)

        **Notifications not received**:
        - Check notification settings in profile
        - Verify email is not in spam folder
        - Ensure browser notifications are enabled
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Editing conflicts between collaborators">
    **Symptoms**: Changes overwritten, duplicate content, merge conflicts.

    **Understanding conflict resolution**:

    Materi uses Operational Transform (OT) to merge simultaneous edits. However, edge cases can occur:

    | Scenario | What happens | Prevention |
    |----------|--------------|------------|
    | Same paragraph edited | Both changes merged | Communicate via comments |
    | Same word edited | Last save wins | Use section locking |
    | Content deleted and edited | Deletion preserved | Check before deleting |
    | Offline edits | Merged on reconnect | Stay connected when collaborating |

    <Tip>
    Use the presence indicators to see where collaborators are working. Avoid editing the same section simultaneously.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot invite or add team members">
    **Symptoms**: Invite button disabled, invitation emails not received, access denied errors.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Check your permissions">
        Only Admins and document owners can invite members. Verify your role in Settings > Team.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify seat availability">
        Your plan may have reached its user limit. Upgrade or remove inactive members.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Check email validity">
        Ensure the email address is valid and not already associated with another workspace.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review spam filters">
        Ask invitees to check spam/junk folders for invitations from `no-reply@materi.io`.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Application running slowly">
    **Symptoms**: Lag when typing, slow page loads, unresponsive interface.

    **Performance optimization checklist**:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Check system requirements">

        - 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended)
        - Modern browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
        - Stable internet (5+ Mbps)
      </Step>
      <Step title="Close unnecessary tabs">
        Each browser tab consumes memory. Close tabs you are not actively using.

      <Step title="Disable heavy browser extensions">
        Ad blockers, Grammarly, and similar extensions can slow down editing.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Clear browser cache">
        Accumulated cache can cause performance issues. Clear it periodically.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Use the desktop app">
        The Materi desktop app (if available for your plan) offers better performance than browsers.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Note>
    If performance issues persist across multiple devices, the problem may be with the document itself. Try creating a new document and copying content in sections.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Images not loading">
    **Symptoms**: Broken image icons, images stuck loading, placeholder shown instead of image.

    | Possible cause | Solution |
    |---------------|----------|
    | Slow internet | Wait or switch to a faster connection |
    | Image deleted from source | Re-upload the image |
    | External link broken | Host image on Materi instead of linking |
    | Image too large | Compress image before uploading |
