## Troubleshooting

    2. **Look for the save indicator** - A spinning icon means saving is in progress
    3. **Refresh the page** - Sometimes a refresh resolves sync issues
    4. **Check for conflicts** - Another user may have made conflicting changes

    If problems persist, [contact support](/support/contact-support) with your document URL.
