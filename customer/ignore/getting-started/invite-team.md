## Inviting Team Members

### Method 1: Email Invitations

The most common way to add team members:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Team Settings">
    1. Click your **workspace name** in the top left
    2. Select **Settings** > **Members**
    3. Or navigate directly: `Cmd/Ctrl + ,` → Members
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Invitations">
    1. Click **Invite Members** or **+ Add**
    2. Enter email addresses (one per line or comma-separated)
    3. Select a default role for all invitees
    4. Add an optional personal message
    5. Click **Send Invitations**

    ```
    alice@company.com
    bob@company.com
    carol@company.com
    ```

    <Tip>
    **Bulk import:** Click **Import from CSV** to upload a list of emails with roles:
    ```csv
    email,role
    alice@company.com,editor
    bob@company.com,viewer
    carol@company.com,admin
    ```
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Invitation Status">
    View pending invitations in the **Pending** tab:

    | Status | Meaning | Action |
    |--------|---------|--------|
    | **Pending** | Invitation sent, not yet accepted | Resend or revoke |
    | **Expired** | Invitation expired (7 days) | Send new invitation |
    | **Accepted** | User joined workspace | Configure role |
    | **Bounced** | Email delivery failed | Verify email address |
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Invite Links

Share a link that anyone can use to join:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Invite Link">
    1. Go to **Settings** > **Members**
    2. Click **Create Invite Link**
    3. Configure link settings:
       - **Default role**: Role assigned to new members
       - **Expiration**: 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or never
       - **Max uses**: Unlimited or specific number
    4. Click **Create Link**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share the Link">
    Copy the generated link and share via:
    - Slack channel announcement
    - Email to distribution list
    - Internal wiki or onboarding docs
    - Calendar invite for new hires
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage Active Links">
    View and manage all active links:

    | Action | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | **Copy** | Copy link to clipboard |
    | **Edit** | Change role or expiration |
    | **Disable** | Temporarily pause the link |
    | **Delete** | Permanently remove the link |

    <Warning>
    Invite links can be used by anyone with access. Use email invitations for sensitive workspaces.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Method 3: Domain Auto-Join (Enterprise)

Allow anyone with a company email to join automatically:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Security** > **Domain Settings**
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter your company domain (e.g., `company.com`)
4. Verify domain ownership via DNS TXT record
5. Enable **Auto-join** and set default role
6. Users with `@company.com` emails can now join without invitation

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph User["New User"]
        SIGNUP["Signs up with<br/>alice@company.com"]
    end

    subgraph Verify["Domain Check"]
        CHECK{{"Domain<br/>Verified?"}}
    end

    subgraph Result["Result"]
        AUTO["Auto-joins<br/>workspace"]
        WAIT["Requires<br/>invitation"]
    end

    SIGNUP --> CHECK
    CHECK -->|"Yes"| AUTO
    CHECK -->|"No"| WAIT

    classDef user fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1976d2
    classDef verify fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#f57c00
    classDef result fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#388e3c

    class SIGNUP user
    class CHECK verify
    class AUTO,WAIT result
```

### Method 4: SCIM Provisioning (Enterprise)

Automatically sync users from your identity provider:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Setup">
    1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Security** > **SCIM**
    2. Click **Enable SCIM**
    3. Copy the **SCIM Base URL** and **Bearer Token**
    4. Configure your IdP with these credentials
    5. Map user attributes (email, name, role)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Supported IdPs">
    - Okta
    - Azure Active Directory
    - OneLogin
    - JumpCloud
    - Google Workspace
    - Custom SCIM 2.0 endpoints
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Benefits">
    - **Automatic provisioning**: New employees get access immediately
    - **Automatic deprovisioning**: Departing employees lose access
    - **Group sync**: IdP groups map to Materi roles
    - **Centralized management**: Single source of truth
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Understanding Roles

Assign the right role based on what each member needs to do:

```mermaid

        EDITOR["Editor"]
        COMMENTER["Commenter"]
        VIEWER["Viewer"]
        GUEST["Guest"]
    end

    OWNER -->|"Full control"| ADMIN
    ADMIN -->|"Manage members"| EDITOR
    EDITOR -->|"Create & edit"| COMMENTER
    COMMENTER -->|"Comment only"| VIEWER
    VIEWER -->|"Read only"| GUEST
