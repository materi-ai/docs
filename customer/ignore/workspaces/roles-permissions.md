# Roles & Permissions

Materi uses a robust role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage what users can do within workspaces. This guide explains the permission model, built-in roles, and how to create custom roles.

## Permission Model Overview

    style E fill:#2563eb,color:#fff
    style F fill:#7c3aed,color:#fff
    style G fill:#64748b,color:#fff
```

Permissions in Materi flow through three levels:

1. **Organization Level**: Controls who can manage billing, create workspaces, and administer the organization
2. **Workspace Level**: Controls access within a specific workspace
3. **Document Level**: Fine-grained control over individual documents

<Note>
Higher-level permissions always include lower-level permissions. An Organization Admin automatically has Admin access to all workspaces.
</Note>

    B -->|Has explicit permission| C[Use document permission]
    B -->|No explicit permission| D[Use workspace role]
    C --> E[Grant Access]
    D --> E

    style A fill:#6366f1,color:#fff

| **Can Edit** | Edit document content |
| **Can Comment** | Add comments only |

## Role Inheritance

Understanding how roles are inherited across the organization:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Organization Owner] -->|Inherits| B[All Workspace Owner]
    C[Organization Admin] -->|Inherits| D[All Workspace Admin]

    E[Workspace Owner] -->|Within workspace| F[Full Access]
    G[Workspace Admin] -->|Within workspace| H[Admin Access]

    I[Group: Engineering] -->|Assigned role| J[Workspace 1: Editor]
    I -->|Assigned role| K[Workspace 2: Admin]

    style A fill:#dc2626,color:#fff
    style C fill:#ea580c,color:#fff
    style I fill:#7c3aed,color:#fff
```

### Inheritance Rules

1. **Organization roles cascade down** to all workspaces
2. **Workspace roles don't cascade up** to organization level
3. **Group membership** applies the group's role in each workspace
4. **Higher role wins** when a user has multiple role assignments
5. **Explicit denials** (No Access) override inherited permissions

## Permission Conflicts

When a user has multiple role assignments, Materi resolves conflicts:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multiple workspace roles">
    If assigned multiple roles (e.g., via groups), the **highest permission wins**.

    Example: User is in "Editors" group (Editor role) and "Reviewers" group (Commenter role) → User has Editor permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document vs. workspace permissions">
    Document-level permissions **override** workspace role for that specific document.

    Example: An Editor with "Can View" on a specific document can only view that document.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Organization vs. workspace roles">
    Organization-level roles **always take precedence** within their scope.

    Example: Organization Admin cannot be demoted to Viewer in any workspace.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Checking Permissions

### For Users

View your permissions:

1. Click your avatar in the workspace
2. Select **My Permissions**
3. See your effective role and capabilities

### For Admins

Check any member's permissions:

1. Go to **Members** > Select member
2. View **Effective Permissions** tab
3. See role sources and inheritance chain

## API Permission Scopes

When creating API keys, select specific permission scopes:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `documents:read` | View documents |
| `documents:write` | Create and edit documents |
| `documents:delete` | Delete documents |
| `members:read` | View member list |
| `members:write` | Manage members |
| `settings:read` | View workspace settings |
| `settings:write` | Modify settings |
| `admin` | Full administrative access |

<Tip>
Always use the minimum scopes needed for your integration. You can create multiple API keys with different scopes for different purposes.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User cannot access a document they should see">
    Check in order:

    1. **Document-level permission** - Is there an explicit "No Access"?
    2. **Workspace membership** - Is user still a workspace member?
    3. **Folder permissions** - Is the folder restricted?
    4. **User status** - Is the user suspended?
    5. **Cache** - Ask user to refresh or clear browser cache
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot change a member's role">
    Common restrictions:

    1. **Your role** - You need Admin or Owner to change roles
    2. **Target's role** - Admins cannot demote Owners
    3. **SSO mapping** - Role may be controlled by SSO
    4. **Group membership** - Role assigned via organization group
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Custom role not appearing">
    Verify:

    1. **Plan eligibility** - Custom roles require Business or Enterprise
    2. **Role status** - Check if role is enabled/disabled
    3. **Workspace scope** - Role may be created in different workspace
    4. **Permissions** - You need Admin to view/assign custom roles
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Inherited permissions not working">
    Debug inheritance:

    1. **Check organization role** - View in organization settings
    2. **Check group memberships** - Review all group assignments
    3. **Check explicit assignments** - Direct workspace role may override
    4. **View effective permissions** - Use the admin tool to see final result
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Regular audits**: Review role assignments quarterly. Remove unnecessary elevated permissions and ensure departing employees are properly offboarded.
</Tip>

1. **Principle of Least Privilege** - Assign the minimum role needed
2. **Use groups** - Manage permissions via groups, not individuals
3. **Document custom roles** - Maintain documentation of custom roles and their purposes
4. **Avoid Owner proliferation** - Limit Owner role to those who truly need it
5. **Test before deploying** - Test custom role configurations before assigning widely
