# Creating Workspaces

Workspaces are the foundational organizational unit in Materi. They provide isolated environments for teams to collaborate on documents, manage content workflows, and maintain security boundaries.

## Overview

A workspace contains all your team's documents, member access controls, integrations, and settings. Each workspace operates independently, allowing organizations to separate projects, departments, or client work.

Create reusable templates for consistent workspace setup:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Save as Template" icon="floppy-disk">
    Convert any configured workspace into a template for future use. Templates include settings, folder structure, and default roles.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Organization Templates" icon="building">
    Admins can create organization-wide templates that enforce company standards and policies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Import Template" icon="file-import">
    Import templates from other workspaces or download community templates from the Materi marketplace.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Template Variables" icon="brackets-curly">
    Use variables in templates for dynamic content like workspace name, creation date, or custom fields.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Creating a Workspace Template

```json
{
  "name": "Client Project Template",
  "description": "Standard setup for client engagements",
  "settings": {
    "visibility": "private",
    "defaultRole": "editor",
    "features": {
      "guestAccess": true,
      "activityLog": true,
      "watermarking": true
    }
  },
  "folders": [
    "Deliverables",
    "Working Documents",
    "Client Feedback",
    "Archive"
  ],
  "roles": ["admin", "editor", "reviewer", "client"]
}
```

## Bulk Workspace Creation

<Info>
Bulk creation is available on Enterprise plans. Contact your account manager for access.
</Info>

For organizations needing multiple workspaces, use the bulk creation API or CSV import:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your CSV">
    Create a CSV file with workspace details:

    ```csv
    name,slug,description,template,owner_email
    Marketing Q1,marketing-q1,Q1 Marketing Campaigns,team-collab,marketing@company.com
    Engineering,engineering,Engineering Documentation,knowledge-base,eng@company.com
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload and Validate">
    Upload your CSV in **Settings** > **Bulk Operations** > **Create Workspaces**. The system validates your data before processing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Confirm">
    Review the preview of workspaces to be created, then confirm to begin batch creation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cannot create workspace - limit reached">
    Your organization has reached its workspace limit. Options:

    1. **Upgrade your plan** to increase limits
    2. **Archive unused workspaces** to free up slots
    3. **Contact support** for temporary limit increase

    Check your current usage in **Settings** > **Usage & Billing**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Workspace slug already exists">
    Workspace slugs must be unique across your organization. Try:

    - Adding a numeric suffix (e.g., `marketing-2024`)
    - Using a more specific name (e.g., `marketing-emea`)
    - Checking if an archived workspace uses the slug
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Template not applying correctly">
    If template settings aren't applying:

    1. Verify you have permission to use the template
    2. Check that all template dependencies are available
    3. Try creating without a template, then applying settings manually
    4. Contact support if the issue persists
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Storage region unavailable">
    Some storage regions require Enterprise plans or specific compliance agreements. Contact your account manager if your required region is unavailable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Naming Convention**: Establish a consistent naming convention across your organization. Example: `[Department]-[Project]-[Year]` results in names like `Marketing-BrandRefresh-2024`.
</Tip>

1. **Plan your structure** before creating workspaces. Map out team needs and access requirements.

2. **Use templates** for consistency across similar workspace types.

3. **Set appropriate defaults** for member roles to reduce manual configuration.

4. **Document your workspaces** with clear descriptions so members understand their purpose.

5. **Regular audits** - Review workspace usage quarterly and archive inactive ones.
