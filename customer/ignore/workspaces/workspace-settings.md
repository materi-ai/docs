## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Settings changes not taking effect">
    1. **Refresh the page** - Some settings require a page refresh

    3. **Check permissions** - Ensure you have Admin or Owner role
    4. **Wait for propagation** - Some settings take up to 5 minutes
    5. **Check plan limits** - Feature may require upgrade
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot access settings">

    3. **API limits** - Third-party service may be rate limiting
    4. **Credentials expired** - Re-authenticate the integration
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhook not firing">
    Debug webhooks:

    1. Check webhook is enabled
    2. Verify URL is accessible from internet
    3. Check event selection matches expected events

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Settings documentation**: Keep a record of your workspace settings and the reasoning behind them. This helps with audits and onboarding new admins.
</Tip>

1. **Security first** - Enable 2FA and set appropriate session timeouts
2. **Least privilege** - Use the most restrictive settings that still allow work
3. **Regular reviews** - Audit settings quarterly
4. **Test changes** - Test in a non-production workspace when possible
5. **Document changes** - Note why settings were changed in audit log comments
