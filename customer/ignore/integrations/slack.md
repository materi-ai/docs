## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Slack integration, ensure you have:

- A Slack workspace with admin permissions (for app installation)
- Materi workspace with Admin role
- Appropriate channels created for notifications

## Setup Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    Go to **Settings > Integrations** in your Materi workspace and locate the Slack integration card.

    The Materi Slack app requests the following permissions:
    - Post messages to channels
    - Send direct messages
    - Use slash commands
    - Add shortcuts to messages
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Default Channel">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Notification Preferences">
    Set up which events trigger notifications and how they're routed to channels or users.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Integration">
    Click **Send Test Message** to verify the integration is working. You should see a test message in your selected channel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

    ```json
    {
      "channel_routing": {
        "default": "#documentation",
        "rules": [
          {
            "event": "review.requested",

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Messages Not Appearing">
    **Symptoms:** Notifications configured but not appearing in Slack.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify the Materi bot is invited to the target channel (`/invite @Materi`)
    2. Check channel permissions allow bot posting
    3. Review notification filters in Materi settings
    4. Verify the integration is still connected (re-authorize if needed)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Buttons Not Working">
    **Symptoms:** Clicking action buttons shows an error or does nothing.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Ensure you're logged into Materi in your browser
    2. Check if your Materi session has expired
    3. Verify you have permission for the action (e.g., reviewer role for approvals)
    4. Clear Slack cache and restart the app
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing Slash Commands">
    **Symptoms:** `/materi` commands not recognized.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify the Materi app is installed in your workspace
    2. Check if slash commands are enabled for the channel
    3. Try in a direct message with Materi bot first
    4. Contact workspace admin to verify app permissions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate Notifications">
    **Symptoms:** Receiving the same notification multiple times.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Check for multiple channel routing rules matching the same event
    2. Verify you're not subscribed to both DM and channel for the same event
    3. Review if multiple team members have forwarding rules
    4. Check for webhook retry attempts in the delivery log
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limits

Slack imposes rate limits on incoming messages:

| Tier | Messages/Minute | Burst Limit |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| Standard | 1 per second | 100 |
| Plus | 1 per second | 100 |
| Enterprise | Higher limits | Contact Slack |

<Note>
Materi automatically queues and batches notifications to stay within Slack rate limits. During high-activity periods, some notifications may be delayed or consolidated.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Use Dedicated Channels:** Create separate channels for different notification types (e.g., #doc-reviews, #doc-updates) to keep discussions organized.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Enable Threading:** Keep related discussions in threads to maintain channel readability and make conversations easier to follow.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Configure Digest Mode:** For less urgent notifications, consider daily or weekly digests instead of real-time alerts to reduce notification fatigue.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Avoid Sensitive Data:** Be mindful that document titles and preview content appear in Slack messages. Use appropriate channel permissions for sensitive documentation.
</Warning>
