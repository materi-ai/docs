Materi Enterprise focuses on operating Materi at scale and in regulated environments.

It is primarily intended for IT, security, and platform teams who need predictable deployment,
clear operational ownership, and documented controls.

## Typical needs

-   SSO and identity integrations
-   Auditability and compliance controls
-   Self-hosted or dedicated deployment models
-   Monitoring, alerting, and operational runbooks

## Where to start

-   Self-hosted: [/enterprise/deployment/self-hosted/overview](/enterprise/deployment/self-hosted/overview)
-   Security posture: [/enterprise/security/overview](/enterprise/security/overview)
-   Monitoring: [/enterprise/monitoring/overview](/enterprise/monitoring/overview)

## How to evaluate fit

-   Identify your deployment model (self-hosted vs. dedicated)
-   Confirm identity requirements (SSO, provisioning)
-   Confirm observability and incident response expectations
