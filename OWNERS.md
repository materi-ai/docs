# Atlas Docs Ownership

This file defines **who owns what** in the documentation.
Ownership means accountability for accuracy, freshness, and review.

## How ownership works

| Role                  | Responsibility                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary owner**     | Reviews all changes, ensures accuracy, schedules updates     |
| **Secondary owner**   | Backup reviewer, escalation path when primary is unavailable |
| **Contributing team** | Can propose changes; changes require owner approval          |

## Escalation path

1. Ping the **primary owner** on the PR or issue.
2. If no response in 2 business days, ping the **secondary owner**.
3. If still blocked, escalate to `@platform-lead` or `@docs-lead`.

## Review requirements

| Change type                | Required reviewers                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| New page                   | Primary owner + 1 from contributing team |
| Content update             | Primary owner                            |
| Structure change (nav, IA) | `@docs-lead` + affected primary owners   |
| Reference regeneration     | Automated (CI gate)                      |
| Ownership change           | Current owner + new owner + `@docs-lead` |

## Stale content process

Pages are considered **stale** if:

-   Not updated in 6 months AND
-   The underlying system has changed

Stale pages should be:

1. Flagged with a `DRAFT:` notice at the top
2. Assigned to the primary owner for refresh
3. Tracked in the docs backlog

## Adding new pages

When adding a new page:

1. Determine which section it belongs to (see matrix above)
2. The primary owner for that section is the default owner
3. Add the page to `docs.json` navigation
4. Ensure the page meets the documentation contract requirements
5. Get approval from the section's primary owner
