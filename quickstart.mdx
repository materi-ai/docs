Use this page to route yourself quickly. For exact request/response shapes, use the API Reference.
For mental models and boundaries, use Architecture and Concepts.

## For contributors

-   Local preview: see [/development](/development)
-   Quality bar: see [/documentation-contract](/documentation-contract)

## Common goals

-   **Integrate via HTTP**: start with the OpenAPI spec and the relevant endpoint group.
-   **Build realtime experiences**: read Concepts, then the Relay WebSocket protocol.
-   **Change backend behavior**: update canonical contracts (OpenAPI and/or events) and run the
    drift checks before opening a PR.
