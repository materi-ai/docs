This snippet shows a copy/paste-friendly pattern for calling an authenticated HTTP endpoint.

```bash
export API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"
export API_TOKEN="REPLACE_ME"

curl -sS "$API_BASE_URL/api/v1/user/profile/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

Notes:

-   `Authorization: Bearer ...` is the standard header shape used across many services.
-   The exact endpoint and token issuance flow depends on the service/environment.
