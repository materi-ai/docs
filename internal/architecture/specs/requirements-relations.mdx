# Requirements Traceability Relationships

This document defines the relationship types used for traceability between requirements.

## Vertical Traceability (Hierarchical)

-   **satisfies**: Lower level requirement satisfies a higher level requirement
-   **implements**: Concrete implementation of an abstract requirement
-   **decomposes_into**: High-level requirement breaks down into detailed requirements
-   **supports**: Enables or facilitates another requirement

## Horizontal Traceability (Peer Relationships)

-   **depends_on**: Requires another requirement for functionality
-   **conflicts_with**: Cannot coexist with another requirement
-   **relates_to**: General relationship or similarity

## Verification Traceability

-   **verified_by**: Test cases that validate the requirement
-   **validates**: Verification artifact validates requirement

## Constraint Traceability

-   **constrains**: Imposes restrictions on implementation
-   **constrained_by**: Subject to restrictions from other requirements

## Change Traceability

-   **affects**: Changes to this requirement impact others
-   **affected_by**: Changes to other requirements impact this one
