This page defines the platform primitives used throughout Materi documentation.
It is intentionally **conceptual** and links out to **canonical specs** when precision matters.

## Workspaces

A **workspace** is the primary multi-tenant boundary for users, documents, and policy.

What to expect:

-   Users are members of one or more workspaces.
-   Most document access decisions are made in the context of a workspace.

## Users and identities

A **user** represents a human or system actor.
Identity and access are centrally managed by the authentication/administration surface (Shield).

High-level capabilities referenced in the repo documentation include:

-   JWT-based auth flows
-   SSO integrations (e.g., SAML) for enterprise
-   RBAC-style authorization concepts

## Documents

A **document** is the primary collaborative unit.
In Materi, documents are designed to support:

-   CRUD operations via the HTTP API
-   Real-time concurrent editing via WebSocket collaboration
-   Version history / lifecycle events

## Real-time collaboration

Collaboration is handled as an always-on stream of operations rather than occasional edits.

Core elements:

-   **Session/connection**: a client’s WebSocket presence within a document
-   **Operation**: an atomic edit submitted by a client
-   **Transform**: conflict resolution that reconciles concurrent operations
-   **Presence**: cursor/selection/user status propagated to other collaborators

## Events

Events are emitted by services to synchronize work across boundaries.

Guiding idea:

-   If a change must be observed by another service (or by downstream consumers), it becomes an **event**.

### Event schemas (protobuf)

<EventProtoSummary />

### OpenAPI (HTTP surface)

HTTP endpoints are defined by the OpenAPI spec published into this docs site:

-   `/openapi/openapi.json`

## Security model (high level)

This documentation treats security as a first-class behavior:

-   **Authentication**: who you are
-   **Authorization**: what you can do
-   **Auditability**: what happened and who triggered it

Concrete endpoint shapes and auth requirements should always be validated against the canonical OpenAPI spec and the relevant service implementation.
