A PR should be reviewable from first principles.

Reviewers should be able to answer “what changed?” and “how do we know it works?” without relying
on out-of-band context.

## Required in the PR description

-   What changed (1–3 bullets)
-   Why (motivation / problem)
-   Verification steps (commands, tests)
-   Docs/spec impact:
    -   OpenAPI changed? (yes/no)
    -   Protobuf events changed? (yes/no)
    -   Docs pages updated? (links)

## Documentation expectations

If a change affects:

-   **End users**: update Customer Docs.
-   **Integrators**: update Developer Guide and/or API Reference.
-   **Operators**: update Enterprise or Internal runbooks.

If a PR changes runtime behavior and does not update docs (or explicitly justify why not), it is incomplete.

## Suggested verification format

-   Service tests/checks (see service `Makefile` / `README.md`)
-   A concrete example request if an endpoint changed
-   `python3 scripts/sync_reference.py --check` (from `platform/atlas`) if contracts or schemas changed
