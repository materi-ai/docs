This section explains how to contribute changes across Materi services _and_ keep documentation verifiable.

## Prerequisites

-   Access to the monorepo and the relevant service(s) under `domain/`, `platform/`, `products/`, or `operations/`.
-   Ability to run the service locally (see the service `README.md` / `Makefile`).

## What “done” means

A change is considered complete when:

-   Code behavior is correct and tested.
-   If behavior is user-facing, the corresponding docs are updated.
-   If behavior is contract/surface-area, the canonical spec is updated:
    -   REST/API: OpenAPI (and derived reference pages)
    -   Events: protobuf schemas in `shared/proto`

## Where docs live

-   Atlas site: `platform/atlas`
-   Canonical event schemas: `shared/proto/*.proto`
-   Source-of-truth policy: [/documentation-contract](/documentation-contract)

## Fast commands (Atlas)

From `platform/atlas`:

-   Local preview: `mint dev`
-   Sync canonical references: `python3 scripts/sync_reference.py`
-   Verify no drift: `python3 scripts/sync_reference.py --check`
-   Audit stubs/missing pages: `python3 scripts/docs_audit.py`
