Use a template that makes the work easy to scope and verify.

An issue is actionable when another engineer can pick it up and reproduce or validate it without
guessing about environments, inputs, or expected outcomes.

## Bug report

Include:

-   Expected behavior
-   Actual behavior
-   Reproduction steps
-   Logs/metrics (if relevant)
-   Affected services

## Feature request

Include:

-   Target audience (customer / developer / enterprise / internal)
-   Desired workflow
-   API/events impact
-   Security/compliance considerations

## Documentation issue

Include:

-   Page link
-   What is incorrect or missing
-   Source of truth (code/spec) that contradicts the docs

## Security-sensitive issues

If the issue involves credentials, access control, or user data, avoid posting secrets or personal
data. Provide sanitized reproduction steps and point to internal logs/telemetry where appropriate.
