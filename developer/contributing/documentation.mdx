Documentation in Materi is treated as an operational artifact.

The goal is that someone new to the system can follow the docs and arrive at the same result you
did, without having to guess which parts are outdated.

## Source-of-truth rules

Follow [/documentation-contract](/documentation-contract).

In short:

-   Don’t duplicate machine-readable truth.
-   Generate or reference OpenAPI/proto/event schemas.
-   Keep narrative docs high-level and link to canonical specs.

## Updating reference material

From `platform/atlas`:

-   Sync canonical references: `python3 scripts/sync_reference.py`
-   Verify no drift: `python3 scripts/sync_reference.py --check`

## Avoiding duplication

Use MDX snippets for content shared across many pages.

-   Snippets live in `platform/atlas/snippets`
-   Import example: `import MySnippet from '/snippets/path/to/file.mdx'`

## Quick checklist

-   Link to the canonical spec when describing API or event shapes.
-   Prefer short “how to verify” steps over long narrative.
-   If you can’t verify something in-repo, say so explicitly and point to the closest source of truth.
